John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper.
He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds.
He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.
John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters,
a width of w meters, a height of h meters.
The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters.
The length of a roll is 10 meters.
He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes
or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.
Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John?
Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.

Example:
wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"
Notes:
all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20
