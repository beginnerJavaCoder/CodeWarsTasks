If you want to run any solution placed here, you need to rename source file you are interested in.
It happens because all source files were named as their tasks, but Java compare names of source file and its public class name.

You can rename the source file into the name of the public class, for example:
ReturnNegative.java -> Kata.java

You can also rename the public class like a source filename:
public class Kata -> public class ReturnNegative

And finally you can copy the code inside class and use its in your own test class. 
Enjoy it!
